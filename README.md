## Introduction

The intricate process of developing and refining the nervous system relies heavily on the formation and elimination of synaptic connections1. Synaptic pruning, a critical mechanism that removes unnecessary or weak synapses to foster circuit refinement and plasticity, plays a vital role in establishing appropriate neural circuits and behaviors2. Various neuropsychiatric disorders have been linked to dysregulation of synaptic pruning2,3. Although this dysregulation has been extensively investigated in schizophrenia4, its involvement in anxiety disorders remains largely unexplored. Anxiety disorders, which affect millions of people globally, are highly prevalent and produce debilitating conditions. Hence, understanding the mechanisms contributing to their development and maintenance is essential.

Research has demonstrated that the α4βδ subtype of GABA(A) receptors contributes to the regulation of synaptic pruning during critical periods of hippocampal5 and dentate gyrus6 brain development. However, the specific function of α4βδ GABA(A) receptors in synaptic pruning within the prelimbic cortex and its impact on adult anxiety response is still unclear. Given the established role of GABAergic neurotransmission in anxiety regulation7, examining the involvement of α4βδ GABA(A) receptors in synaptic pruning of the prelimbic cortex could offer valuable insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for anxiety disorders' development and maintenance.

This thesis utilizes a combination of histological techniques, pharmacological and genetic interventions, and behavioral assays to investigate the involvement of α4βδ GABAA receptors in dendritic pruning of the prelimbic cortex and its subsequent effects on anxiety response in adulthood. The study aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which α4βδ GABAA receptors regulate synaptic pruning in the prelimbic cortex by quantifying the expression of α4βδ GABAA receptors and spine proteins during puberty, manipulating synaptic pruning through GABAARs drug administration, and comparing spine density and protein expression in constitutive knock-out and conditional knock-down mice. Ultimately, this research seeks to deepen our understanding of synaptic pruning's role in anxiety disorders and offer insight into the potential therapeutic value of targeting α4βδ GABAA receptors for anxiety treatment.

### Anxiety Disorders

### Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive fear, worry, and physiological symptoms and are among the most prevalent and debilitating psychiatric conditions worldwide. Anxiety disorders are primarily defined by two major classification systems: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11; World Health Organization, 2018). Both systems describe anxiety disorders as a heterogeneous group of conditions marked by excessive fear, anxiety, and avoidance behavior, often accompanied by somatic symptoms.

### The DSM-5 and ICD-11 identify several subtypes of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), specific phobias (SP), and separation anxiety disorder (SeAD). Additionally, the DSM-5 includes agoraphobia and selective mutism as distinct anxiety disorders, while the ICD-11 categorizes them as phobic anxiety disorders and childhood-onset fluency disorder, respectively. Descriptions and symptoms of each of these subtypes can be found in Table 1.1.

### Research on the prevalence of anxiety disorders has generated varied estimates due to methodological differences, diagnostic criteria, and sample characteristics. However, converging evidence from large-scale, population-based studies and meta-analyses suggests that anxiety disorders are highly prevalent worldwide. In a seminal study, Kessler et al. (2005) estimated the lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders in the United States at 28.8%, with 12-month prevalence rates of 18.1%. Similarly, the World Mental Health Survey Initiative, spanning 25 countries, reported a global lifetime prevalence of 16.6% and a 12-month prevalence of 11.2% (Kessler et al., 2009). A recent meta-analysis of 87 studies conducted by Baxter et al. (2013) revealed a global lifetime prevalence of 16.7% and a 12-month prevalence of 10.6%. The prevalence of anxiety disorders varies according to gender, age, and cultural factors. Female individuals consistently exhibit higher rates of anxiety disorders compared to male individuals, with a pooled lifetime prevalence of 20.5% and 13.1%, respectively (Remes et al., 2016). Moreover, the onset of anxiety disorders typically occurs during adolescence, with peak prevalence rates observed between ages 15 and 24 (Kessler et al., 2005; McLaughlin et al., 2011).

### Several methodological challenges can influence the assessment of anxiety disorder prevalence. Heterogeneity in study design, sampling strategies, and diagnostic criteria contribute to discrepancies in prevalence estimates (Wittchen et al., 2011). For example, studies utilizing self-report questionnaires may overestimate prevalence rates due to the lack of clinical validation, whereas studies relying on structured clinical interviews may underestimate prevalence by not capturing subthreshold cases (Balázs et al., 2013; Goodwin et al., 2017). Furthermore, fluctuations in diagnostic criteria over time and between classification systems (e.g., DSM-IV vs. DSM-5, ICD-10 vs. ICD-11) can lead to variations in prevalence rates (Clark et al., 2017). The inclusion or exclusion of specific anxiety disorders, such as agoraphobia and selective mutism, can further impact prevalence estimates.

#### Current Treatments

### The current treatments for anxiety disorders, while providing some relief, have limited efficacy due to our incomplete understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms driving these disorders. The primary treatment modalities for anxiety disorders include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and, in some cases, a combination of both. However, a significant proportion of patients do not achieve full remission or experience adverse side effects, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of anxiety disorders.

### Pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders primarily target neurotransmitter systems, such as the serotonergic, noradrenergic, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems. Benzodiazepines, the most prescribed class of anxiolytics, have been in use for several decades. Despite their widespread application, benzodiazepines exhibit several drawbacks. For instance, they are associated with a high risk of dependence and adverse effects, such as cognitive impairment and sedation (Baldwin et al., 2013). Additionally, benzodiazepines do not address the root causes of anxiety disorders and only provide symptomatic relief (Depping et al., 2016). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are other pharmacological treatments frequently utilized for anxiety disorders. While they exhibit a better side effect profile compared to benzodiazepines, their anxiolytic effects often take weeks to manifest (Bandelow et al., 2017). Moreover, a substantial proportion of patients do not respond adequately to these medications, highlighting the need for more targeted therapeutic approaches (Watanabe et al., 2018). The limitations of current pharmacological treatments can be attributed, in part, to the lack of understanding of the specific neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to anxiety disorders. Recent research has identified multiple pathways and neurotransmitter systems that may play a role in the etiology of anxiety disorders, including the glutamatergic, GABAergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic systems (Bandelow et al., 2016; Lueken & Hahn, 2016).

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a widely employed psychotherapeutic intervention for anxiety disorders, focusing on identifying and modifying maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors. While CBT has demonstrated efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms, not all patients respond to this approach. Additionally, access to qualified therapists and the time-consuming nature of therapy can limit the feasibility and effectiveness of CBT for some individuals. The limitations of current treatment options highlight the importance of advancing our knowledge of the physiological mechanisms underpinning anxiety disorders. A more comprehensive understanding of these processes will enable the development of targeted and personalized interventions, enhancing treatment efficacy and minimizing adverse effects. This underscores the critical need for ongoing research into the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders, which will be discussed in the subsequent section.

#### Pathophysiology

### Investigating the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders has been an area of growing interest, with particular focus on the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the regulation of fear and anxiety. The PFC is a complex brain region that governs higher-order cognitive functions, including decision-making, emotional regulation, and behavioral flexibility. Research has identified several prefrontal subregions that are implicated in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets. For example, recent studies have highlighted alterations in GABA gene expression within PFC regions associated with anxiety (Cui et al., 2018).

### One such subregion is the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which has extensive connections with the amygdala, hippocampus, and other limbic structures that are involved in the processing of fear and emotional memories. The mPFC is critical for the regulation of fear responses, with its ventral portion, including the infralimbic cortex, promoting fear extinction, and the dorsal portion, including the prelimbic cortex, facilitating fear expression (Milad & Quirk, 2012). Dysregulation of mPFC activity, particularly in the prelimbic cortex, has been associated with heightened fear responses and impaired fear extinction, both of which are hallmark features of anxiety disorders (Marek et al., 2013).

### Neuroimaging studies have provided further evidence of altered PFC functioning in individuals with anxiety disorders. For instance, reduced activation and gray matter volume in the mPFC have been observed in patients with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder (Etkin & Wager, 2007; Liao et al., 2011; Shin & Liberzon, 2010). These findings suggest that aberrant PFC activity may contribute to the development and persistence of anxiety symptoms, warranting further investigation into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these alterations.

### Medial Prefrontal Cortex

### The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a crucial part of the human brain, located in the anterior region of the frontal lobes. This neural tissue is essential for higher-order cognitive processes, including decision-making, social behavior, and emotion regulation, all of which contribute to our understanding of anxiety disorders (Davidson & McEwen, 2012).

### Anatomically, the PFC is divided into several subregions, with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) playing a central role in the modulation of anxiety-related behavior. The mPFC encompasses the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), among other areas. Each of these subdivisions has unique cellular structures and neural connections that contribute to the regulation of anxiety (Etkin et al., 2011; Etkin et al., 2009; Milad et al., 2007). The dACC is a critical hub for processing cognitive conflict and emotional information. It comprises six layers of neurons, with the largest pyramidal cells in layer V. These cells project to various brain regions, such as the amygdala and hypothalamus, which are involved in emotional processing and stress responses. Research by Etkin et al. (2011) demonstrated that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) exhibited heightened dACC activation during tasks requiring emotion regulation, indicating a possible role for this region in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders. The pgACC is situated anterior and ventral to the dACC. This region contains densely packed neurons and is known for its extensive connections with limbic and paralimbic structures, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula. These connections enable the pgACC to modulate emotional responses and monitor internal states. A study by Etkin et al. (2009) revealed that patients with GAD displayed reduced pgACC activation during emotion regulation tasks, suggesting that dysfunction in this region may contribute to maladaptive emotional processing in anxiety disorders. The vmPFC, located ventral to the dACC and pgACC, is involved in the appraisal and regulation of emotional stimuli. It contains neurons organized in six layers and projects to several limbic and paralimbic areas, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. The vmPFC has been implicated in the extinction of conditioned fear responses, a process relevant to the treatment of anxiety disorders. Milad et al. (2007) found that individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibited diminished vmPFC activation during fear extinction tasks, indicating that this region may be crucial for understanding and treating anxiety-related conditions.

#### Executive Function

### Executive function, a critical cognitive process regulated by the prefrontal cortex, plays a vital role in the context of anxiety disorders. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), in particular, is integral to executive function and heavily implicated in anxiety-related processes (Bishop, 2009). This section will delve into the importance of executive function and its relationship with anxiety disorders, as well as the specific involvement of the mPFC.

### Executive function encompasses several cognitive processes, such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control, which enable goal-directed behavior, decision-making, and adaptation to novel situations (Diamond, 2013). In anxiety disorders, these processes are often dysregulated, leading to maladaptive behaviors and heightened anxiety levels. Research by Bishop (2009) demonstrates that individuals with anxiety disorders exhibit atypical mPFC activity which can impair executive function and exacerbate symptoms.

### A key component of executive function is working memory – the temporary storage and manipulation of information necessary for complex cognitive tasks. Eysenck et al. (2007) found that anxiety impairs working memory, with the mPFC being a central player in this dysfunction. Moreover, impaired working memory may result in reduced ability to regulate anxious thoughts and emotions, further worsening anxiety symptoms (Vytal & Hamann, 2010).

### Cognitive flexibility, another critical aspect of executive function, refers to the ability to shift attention and adapt to changes in the environment or task demands. In anxiety disorders, reduced cognitive flexibility is associated with rigid thinking patterns and difficulty disengaging from negative stimuli (Derryberry & Reed, 2002). The mPFC has been implicated in this dysfunction, as demonstrated by a study conducted by Cisler and Koster (2010), where it was found that individuals with anxiety disorders displayed altered mPFC activity during tasks requiring cognitive flexibility.

### Inhibitory control – the ability to suppress irrelevant or inappropriate thoughts, behaviors, and emotions – is also crucial in managing anxiety symptoms. Disrupted inhibitory control can lead to heightened anxiety due to difficulty in suppressing negative emotions and intrusive thoughts (Etkin & Schatzberg, 2011). Goldin et al. (2013) reported that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder exhibited abnormal mPFC activation during tasks requiring inhibitory control, suggesting a direct link between mPFC dysfunction and anxiety disorders. *Rodent Analogue*

The rodent prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) cortex, both subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), have been extensively studied for their role in various cognitive and emotional processes. This section aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the PL and IL cortex, comparing their functions and circuitry, while focusing on their involvement in schizophrenia and anxiety.

The prelimbic cortex is located in the dorsal part of the mPFC and plays a crucial role in executive functions, decision-making, and goal-directed behaviors (Vertes, 2004). It has extensive connections with other brain regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens. The infralimbic cortex, situated ventrally to the prelimbic cortex, is involved in emotional regulation, extinction learning, and the suppression of inappropriate behavioral responses (Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011). It shares similar connections with the aforementioned brain regions but with different innervation patterns. *![Diagram Description automatically generated](media/5e39b8419007953319f6df2f84a55226.png)*

In rodent models of schizophrenia, the PL cortex displays abnormal functioning, with disruptions in excitatory and inhibitory balance. Specifically, alterations in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission have been observed (Lodge & Grace, 2007). These imbalances contribute to the cognitive deficits and positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the dysregulation of dopamine in the PL cortex plays a role in the pathophysiology of the disease (Grace et al., 2017). The IL cortex has been less studied in schizophrenia; however, it is also implicated in disease due to its connections with the amygdala and hippocampus. Similar to the PL cortex, alterations in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission have been observed in the IL cortex in rodent models of schizophrenia (Balu & Coyle 2011). The IL cortex may contribute to the negative symptoms and emotional dysregulation observed in the disorder.

The PL cortex has been implicated in the generation and regulation of anxiety-related behaviors. In rodent models, increased activity in the PL cortex correlates with heightened anxiety, while inhibition of the PL cortex reduces anxiety-like behaviors (Adhikari et al., 2015). The PL cortex modulates anxiety through its connections with the amygdala, particularly the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is involved in processing emotionally salient stimuli and generating fear responses (Rosenkranz & Grace, 2002). Dysregulation of the PL-BLA circuitry may contribute to the development of anxiety disorders. The IL cortex plays a significant role in regulating anxiety and fear responses. It has been demonstrated that activation of the IL cortex promotes the extinction of conditioned fear, while its inhibition impairs extinction learning (Milad & Quirk, 2012). The IL cortex exerts its anxiolytic effects through its connections with the amygdala via inhibitory interneurons (Amano et al., 2010), particularly the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), which is a critical output structure for fear and anxiety responses (Ciocchi et al., 2010). Moreover, the IL cortex is involved in modulating stress responses via its connections with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Radley et al., 2006).

Both the PL and IL cortex are implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and anxiety due to their involvement in emotion processing and regulation. Dysregulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission is observed in both subregions in schizophrenia, while altered connectivity with the amygdala plays a role in anxiety disorders. The PL cortex is more prominently involved in executive functions and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas the IL cortex is more associated with negative symptoms and emotional dysregulation. In anxiety, the PL cortex contributes to the generation of anxiety-related behaviors, while the IL cortex is crucial for the regulation of fear responses and anxiety.

### Adolescence

Adolescence represents a critical period in human development, characterized by significant physiological, psychological, and cognitive changes. During this time, the brain undergoes extensive remodeling, particularly within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a key region implicated in the maturation of executive functions and the emergence of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and schizophrenia (Casey et al., 2008). To better understand the neurobiology of adolescence, this section will elucidate the processes of synaptic pruning, neural circuit development, and dendritic spine formation, which are integral to the maturation of the mPFC.

Gray matter comprises cell bodies, dendrites, and synapses, and it plays a crucial role in information processing. During adolescence, the brain undergoes region-specific gray matter changes. For example, Giedd et al. (1999) observed a nonlinear pattern of gray matter development, with cortical thickness increasing during childhood and subsequently decreasing during adolescence. Notably, these alterations occurred in a region-specific manner, with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) experiencing the most pronounced changes. This finding suggests that gray matter maturation, particularly in the PFC, may be an essential factor in the development of executive functions and cognitive control; both are often impaired in individuals with anxiety disorders (Casey et al., 2008).

White matter, primarily composed of myelinated axons, facilitates communication between different brain regions. During adolescence, the brain undergoes substantial white matter growth, leading to improved information transfer and integration (Asato et al., 2010). A landmark study by Barnea-Goraly et al. (2005) employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to reveal that fractional anisotropy—a measure of white matter integrity—increased with age in various brain regions, including the PFC. These findings indicate that the adolescent brain is characterized by ongoing development of white matter, which may contribute to enhanced cognitive abilities and the regulation of emotions, both of which are relevant to the emergence of anxiety disorders. Myelination is the process by which oligodendrocytes wrap around axons to form a myelin sheath, which increases the speed and efficiency of neural transmission. The adolescent brain experiences significant increases in myelination, particularly in the PFC (Paus et al., 2001). This increased myelination is thought to improve connectivity between different brain regions and enhance cognitive abilities such as decision-making, impulse control, and emotion regulation (Blakemore & Choudhury, 2006). These processes are critical for adaptive behavior and coping with stress; their disruption may contribute to the development of anxiety disorders.

Functional connectivity refers to the temporal correlations between spatially separated brain regions, reflecting the degree of coordination between these areas. During adolescence, functional connectivity undergoes dynamic changes, with a general shift from short-range to long-range connectivity (Fair et al., 2009). This reorganization promotes the integration of information across disparate brain regions and supports the development of advanced cognitive and emotional processes. Alterations in functional connectivity—particularly within the PFC and its connections to other regions—have been implicated in the etiology of anxiety disorders (Sylvester et al., 2012).

#### 

#### Synaptic Pruning in Adolescent Brain Development

#### Synaptic pruning is an essential process for refining neural circuitry and optimizing brain function during adolescence, ultimately contributing to maturation of cognitive and emotional processing (Petanjek et al., 2011). During this period, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) undergoes substantial synaptic pruning where synapses have been shown to decrease by roughly half (Huttenlocher & Dabholkar, 1997). This process is influenced by various factors, including genetics, environmental stimuli, and neuronal activity. The precise mechanisms underlying synaptic pruning remain an area of active research, but several key cellular and molecular players have been identified.

#### Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, have been implicated in the synaptic pruning process. In a landmark study by Schafer et al. (2012), microglia were found to engulf and eliminate synapses in the developing mouse brain, with the complement system playing a critical role in this process. Complement proteins such as C1q and C3 tag synapses for removal; microglia recognize these tags to selectively phagocytose the targeted synapses.

#### 

#### Neuronal Activity and Signaling Molecules in Synaptic Pruning

#### Neuronal activity is another crucial factor that influences synaptic pruning. During development, synapses that are more active and transmit stronger signals are preferentially maintained, whereas weaker and fewer active synapses are eliminated (Bourgeois & Rakic, 1993). This activity-dependent pruning process is mediated by various signaling molecules such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NMDA receptors. BDNF has been shown to promote stabilization and maturation of synapses (McAllister et al., 1999), while NMDA receptor activation can lead to long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD), depending on the strength and duration of synaptic activity (Collingridge et al., 2010).

#### Disruptions in the synaptic pruning process during adolescence have been implicated in the development of anxiety disorders. Abnormal pruning in the PFC may lead to an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, resulting in maladaptive neural circuitry that predisposes individuals to anxiety (Casey et al., 2008). For example, excessive pruning of inhibitory synapses or inadequate pruning of excitatory synapses may cause hyperactivity in the PFC, resulting in heightened anxiety and stress responses (Waters et al., 2015). In conclusion, adolescence is a critical period marked by significant changes in brain structure and function. Understanding the processes of synaptic pruning, myelination, and functional connectivity during this time can provide crucial insights into the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety. Future research should continue to explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these processes to inform the development of targeted interventions for adolescents at risk for psychiatric disorders.

Functional connectivity refers to the temporal correlations between spatially separated brain regions, reflecting the degree of coordination between these areas. During adolescence, functional connectivity undergoes dynamic changes, with a general shift from short-range to long-range connectivity (Fair et al., 2009). This reorganization promotes the integration of information across disparate brain regions and supports the development of advanced cognitive and emotional processes. Alterations in functional connectivity, particularly within the PFC and its connections to other regions, have been implicated in the etiology of anxiety disorders (Sylvester et al., 2012).

#### Dendritic Spines

Dendritic spines, small protrusions emerging from dendrites of neurons, play a critical role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. They serve as the primary site of excitatory synaptic input, which enables them to participate actively in the reception, integration, and transmission of neural signals. In the context of adolescence, dendritic spine development and maturation is highly dynamic, with significant implications for the emergence of anxiety disorders due to abnormalities in synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex.

During adolescence, the brain undergoes significant changes, including alterations in dendritic spine density and morphology. These changes are crucial for the refinement of neural circuits and the establishment of efficient communication between brain regions. Animal studies have shown that the number of dendritic spines in the prefrontal cortex increases during early adolescence, followed by a decline in density because of synaptic pruning (Petanjek et al., 2011). This reduction in spine density is believed to reflect a process of synaptic refinement, allowing for the optimization of neural circuits, and contributing to the maturation of cognitive and emotional processing. Abnormalities in dendritic spine development during adolescence can have profound consequences for neural circuitry and the emergence of anxiety disorders. Research has shown that excessive or insufficient synaptic pruning can lead to imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, ultimately resulting in dysfunctional neural circuits (Bourne & Harris, 2011). This dysfunction can manifest as an increased susceptibility to anxiety disorders, as the affected individual may struggle to regulate emotional responses and process environmental stimuli effectively.

A study conducted by Pattwell et al. (2016) demonstrated that altered dendritic spine dynamics in the prefrontal cortex during adolescence can lead to anxiety-like behaviors in rodents. The researchers found that mice exposed to chronic stress during adolescence exhibited reduced dendritic spine density and abnormal spine morphology in the prefrontal cortex. These changes were accompanied by heightened anxiety-like behaviors, suggesting that alterations in dendritic spine dynamics might contribute to the development of anxiety disorders. Further evidence for the role of dendritic spines in anxiety disorders comes from studies investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying spine formation and pruning. For instance, alterations in the expression and function of key proteins involved in spine development, such as the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and the actin-regulating protein cofilin, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders (Carlisle et al., 2011; Garey et al., 2010). Understanding the molecular basis of dendritic spine dynamics during adolescence may provide valuable insights into the etiology of anxiety disorders and inform the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.

#### Spine Proteins

In the context of synaptic signaling and plasticity, several key proteins play crucial roles in regulating neuronal function and structure. AMPA and NMDA receptors are ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate excitatory synaptic transmission, with NMDA receptors being particularly important for synaptic plasticity. α4βδ GABAARs are a subtype of ionotropic GABA receptors that contribute to inhibitory synaptic transmission, modulating the overall excitability of neurons. CaMKII, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, is involved in various cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity and learning. CDK5, a serine/threonine kinase, is also implicated in synaptic plasticity and can activate Kalirin-7, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that regulates the activity of Rho GTPases. Among these Rho GTPases, Rac1 is essential for controlling the actin cytoskeleton and promoting dendritic spine expansion. Together, these proteins form intricate signaling networks that govern neuronal function and plasticity, shaping the way our brains process and store information.

Table 2.1 *Proteins involved in the discussed pathways that are located within the synaptic spine:*

#### Signaling Pathways

The glutamate-induced molecular pathway is a complex and highly regulated series of events that ultimately leads to changes in the structure and function of the postsynaptic neuron. Glutamate binds to AMPA receptors, causing an influx of Na+ ions into the postsynaptic neuron and depolarizing the cell (Collingridge et al., 2004). Depolarization removes Mg2+ ions blocking NMDA receptors, allowing Ca2+ ions to enter the postsynaptic neuron (Mayer et al., 1984). Elevated intracellular Ca2+ activates the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway, which generates second messengers IP3 and DAG (Berridge, 1993). IP3 binds to IP3 receptors on the ER membrane, releasing more Ca2+ ions from the ER stores into the cytoplasm (Mikoshiba, 2007). Increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ activates Ca2+-dependent kinases, such as CaMKII, which is involved in synaptic plasticity and learning (Lisman et al., 2002). Activated CaMKII phosphorylates downstream targets, including CDK5 (Dhavan & Tsai, 2001). Activated CDK5 phosphorylates Kalirin-7, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates the activity of Rho GTPases, including Rac1 and RhoA (Xie et al., 2007). Activated Kalirin-7 in turn activates Rac1, a critical regulator of the actin cytoskeleton (Tolias et al., 2011). Rac1 activation promotes new actin filament formation and dendritic spine expansion, influencing synaptic strength and contributing to long-term changes in neuronal function during learning and memory formation (Penzes et al., 2011).

#### α4βδ GABAA Receptors

The α4βδ GABA_A receptor is a heteropentameric ligand-gated ion channel composed of α4, β, and δ subunits, with a stoichiometry typically arranged as 2α:2β:1δ (Barrera et al., 2008). The subunit composition and arrangement within the receptor complex are crucial for its unique functional properties, which ultimately impact synaptic pruning in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and consequently anxiety disorders (Shen et al., 2010).

The α4 subunit, encoded by the GABRA4 gene, is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus during puberty (Gao & Fritschy, 1995). It is noteworthy that the α4 subunit expression is upregulated during critical periods of synaptic pruning, implicating its potential role in anxiety-related neuroplasticity (Smith et al., 2007). The α4 subunit is responsible for conferring certain pharmacological properties to the receptor, including insensitivity to the classical benzodiazepine site modulators, such as diazepam (Wafford et al., 1996). The β subunit, commonly β2 or β3, is encoded by the GABRB2 and GABRB3 genes, respectively (Simon et al., 2004). These subunits contribute to the formation of the GABA binding site and influence the receptor's kinetic properties, including channel opening and desensitization (Amin & Weiss, 1993). Furthermore, the β subunit is vital for the proper trafficking and membrane insertion of the α4βδ receptor (Kang et al., 1996). The δ subunit, encoded by the GABRD gene, is essential for the receptor's distinct functional properties. It is primarily found extrasynaptically in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus and is responsible for the high sensitivity of α4βδ receptors to low GABA concentrations (Stell et al., 2003). Moreover, the δ subunit confers a unique pharmacological profile to the α4βδ receptor, characterized by insensitivity to benzodiazepines and sensitivity to neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone (Mihalek et al., 1999).

The assembly of the α4βδ GABA_A receptor is a highly regulated process involving multiple steps, including subunit synthesis, folding, assembly, trafficking, and insertion into the membrane (Connolly et al., 1996). The assembly is facilitated by chaperone proteins, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident protein BiP, which ensures proper folding and assembly of the receptor subunits (Kumar et al., 2010). After assembly, the heteropentameric receptor is trafficked to the membrane, where it is inserted into the lipid bilayer and incorporated into the postsynaptic density, allowing for functional synaptic integration (Sarto-Jackson & Sieghart, 2008).

#### Ligand binding sites and activation mechanisms

The α4βδ GABAA receptor plays a vital role in modulating anxiety disorders due to its distinct ligand binding sites and activation mechanisms that provide a foundation for its therapeutic potential. The primary endogenous ligand of the α4βδ GABAA receptor is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The GABA binding site is located at the interface between the α4 and β subunits, as demonstrated by in vitro binding assays and structural studies (Baur et al., 2006; Miller et al., 2017). Upon GABA's binding at this site, a conformational change in the receptor occurs, which in turn facilitates the opening of the integral chloride channel, thereby hyperpolarizing the postsynaptic membrane and reducing neuronal excitability.

GABA_ARs facilitate chloride anion movement across the membrane, with the direction contingent on the chloride reversal potential during resting membrane potential. Governed by the Nernst equation, the chloride reversal potential depends on the concentration gradient. At room temperature, the simplified equation becomes E_Cl = -58 \* log [Cl]_out/[Cl]_in. In most adult CNS regions, extracellular chloride concentration is higher, resulting in a more negative reversal potential. Consequently, GABA_AR opening leads to intracellular hyperpolarization as negatively charged chloride flows into the cell (Staley & Mody, 1992). However, conditions with higher intracellular chloride concentrations, such as early development, result in depolarization as chloride flows extracellularly (Ben-Ari et al., 1989). If the chloride reversal potential and resting membrane potential are similar, minimal chloride flux occurs, yielding shunting inhibition regardless of direction. This results in either hyperpolarization or inhibition depending upon specific conditions within neurons (Isaacson & Walmsley, 1995).

Benzodiazepines, a class of psychoactive drugs, bind allosterically to GABAA receptors, enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission. However, α4βδ GABAA receptors display complete insensitivity to benzodiazepines due to a specific amino acid residue in the α4 subunit (Wafford et al., 1996) and the absence of the gamma subunit. This resistance has prompted the search for alternative anxiolytic agents that selectively target the α4βδ receptor subtype.

Neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone and pregnenolone sulfate, have been shown to modulate GABAA receptors, including α4βδ receptors (Akk et al., 2017). The neurosteroid binding site is situated in the transmembrane domain at the interface of α4 and δ subunits. Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), such as allopregnanolone, potentiate GABAergic inhibition by enhancing GABA binding and channel opening, whereas negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), such as pregnenolone sulfate, reduce GABAergic inhibition (Paul & Purdy, 1992). Neurosteroids have been implicated in anxiety disorders, and targeting the α4βδ receptor's neurosteroid binding site has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach (Reddy, 2010).

The activation of α4βδ GABAA receptors involves conformational changes in response to ligand binding. Upon GABA binding at the orthosteric site, the receptor transitions from a closed, resting state to an open, active state, allowing chloride ions to flow through the channel pore. This influx of negatively charged ions inhibits the neuronal membrane by reducing action potential likelihood. PAMs and NAMs bind to the allosteric site and modulate the receptor's response to GABA, enhancing or diminishing its effect, respectively (Glykys et al., 2007). The α4βδ receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) have been implicated in anxiety-related behaviors. Enhanced α4βδ receptor activity within the mPFC has been shown to promote anxiolysis in animal models of anxiety (Glykys et al., 2007; Maguire et al., 2005). This effect is hypothesized to result from increased inhibitory tone in the mPFC, reducing excessive excitatory activity often observed in anxiety disorders.

#### GABAergic Inhibition

Synaptic and extrasynaptic α4βδ GABAA receptors play unique roles in regulating neuronal membrane potential. Both receptor types are activated by the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but they differ in location, kinetics, and membrane potential effects. Synaptic α4βδ GABAA receptors, primarily found at the synapse, enable rapid inhibitory synaptic communication. GABA activation causes structural changes that open chloride ion channels, resulting in membrane hyperpolarization, decreased neuronal excitability, and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). These synaptic receptors have a brief impact on membrane potential due to their fast activation and desensitization kinetics. Extrasynaptic α4βδ GABAA receptors are located outside the synapse on the neuronal membrane. Activated by low GABA concentrations, these receptors demonstrate higher affinity for GABA and slower kinetics than synaptic receptors. Extrasynaptic α4βδ GABAA receptor activation generates a persistent tonic inhibitory current by allowing Cl- ions to flow into the neuron. This prolonged hyperpolarization reduces overall neuronal excitability and is crucial for controlling neuronal network activity and fine-tuning synaptic transmission.

The expression of α4βδ GABAARs and the resulting enhanced inhibitory signaling can significantly impact the activation of Kalirin-7 and its downstream effects on actin production. Enhanced activity of α4βδ GABAARs increases inhibitory signaling, counteracting depolarization induced by excitatory signaling through AMPA receptors. This makes it more challenging for the postsynaptic neuron to reach the threshold necessary to expel Mg2+ ions from NMDA receptors. Consequently, there is a reduced probability of Mg2+ removal from NMDA receptors, leading to decreased Ca2+ influx into the postsynaptic neuron. This causes a lower intracellular Ca2+ concentration and weaker activation of Ca2+-dependent pathways, such as the CaMKII pathway. Diminished activation results in reduced phosphorylation and activation of CDK5, a downstream target of CaMKII. CDK5 is crucial for Kalirin-7 phosphorylation and activation, so reduced CDK5 activation leads to decreased Kalirin-7 phosphorylation. This reduction negatively impacts Kalirin-7's ability to regulate Rho GTPases like Rac1, leading to decreased Rac1 activation. Rac1 plays a vital role in promoting new actin filament formation and dendritic spine expansion essential for synaptic connections between neurons. Therefore, reduced Rac1 activation due to decreased Kalirin-7 phosphorylation likely results in diminished actin production and fewer structural changes in the postsynaptic neuron. In summary, increased inhibitory signaling from α4βδ GABAARs can disrupt normal molecular pathways and alter the structure and function of postsynaptic neurons.

#### 1.1 Assess synaptic pruning in Layer 2/3 and Layer 5 of female wildtype mice's prelimbic cortex during pubertal, postpubertal, and adult stages by characterizing alterations in density and morphology of various spine types.

In this study, we aimed to assess synaptic pruning in the prelimbic cortex of female wildtype mice during different developmental stages, namely pubertal, postpubertal, and adult stages. We examined Layer 2/3 and Layer 5 of the prelimbic cortex, focusing on spine density and morphology. The dataset we analyzed, provided in the attached CSV file, includes mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) values for total, motile, and stable spine density, as well as mean and SEM values for various spine types, such as filopodia, thin, long-thin, mushroom, stubby, and bifurcated.

To determine statistical significance, we conducted independent t-tests comparing total mean spine density between pubertal and postpubertal wildtype female mice for Layer 2/3 and Layer 5. Additionally, one-way ANOVA was performed to analyze differences in spine density and morphology across the three developmental stages for the various spine types.

For Layer 2/3, our analysis revealed a significant decrease in total mean spine density from the pubertal stage (M = 31.03, SEM = 2.45) to the postpubertal stage (M = 16.50, SEM = 1.63) (t(72) = 5.26, p \< 0.001). Moreover, the one-way ANOVA results indicated significant differences in spine density and morphology for thin, long-thin, mushroom, stubby, and bifurcated spine types across the three developmental stages. Similarly, in Layer 5, we found a significant reduction in total mean spine density from the pubertal stage (M = 9.41, SEM = 0.91) to the postpubertal stage (M = 5.52, SEM = 0.57) (t(50) = 3.53, p \< 0.01). The one-way ANOVA results also showed significant differences in spine density and morphology for filopodia, thin, long-thin, mushroom, stubby, and bifurcated spine types across the three developmental stages.

In conclusion, our statistical analysis suggests that synaptic pruning occurs in the prelimbic cortex of female wildtype mice during different developmental stages, as evidenced by the significant differences observed in total mean spine density between pubertal and postpubertal stages for both Layer 2/3 and Layer 5. Furthermore, our findings reveal significant differences in the density of various spine types across the three developmental stages, indicating that alterations in spine density and morphology are associated with the synaptic pruning process. These results contribute to our understanding of the neurobiological changes occurring during the development of female wildtype mice and may help in exploring the functional implications of synaptic pruning in the prelimbic cortex.

#### 1.2. Analyze synaptic pruning in Layer 5 of male wildtype mice's prelimbic cortex during pubertal and postpubertal stages and contrast with female mice, focusing on spine density and morphology to detect potential sex-related differences.

Synaptic pruning is a critical process in the development of the nervous system, where unnecessary synapses are eliminated, and the remaining synapses are strengthened. In this study, we aimed to investigate the synaptic pruning in Layer 2/3 and Layer 5 of the prelimbic cortex in female wildtype mice during pubertal, postpubertal, and adult stages. To do this, we examined spine density and morphology using the attached CSV file, which contains data on mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) values for total, motile, and stable spine density, as well as mean and SEM values for various spine types, including filopodia, thin, long-thin, mushroom, stubby, and bifurcated.

Our statistical analysis involved independent t-tests to compare the total mean spine density between pubertal and postpubertal wildtype female mice in both Layer 2/3 and Layer 5. Additionally, we conducted one-way ANOVA to evaluate differences in spine density and morphology across the three developmental stages for different spine types.

In Layer 2/3, our analysis showed a significant reduction in total mean spine density between pubertal (M = 31.03, SEM = 2.45) and postpubertal (M = 16.50, SEM = 1.63) wildtype female mice (t(72) = 5.26, p \< 0.001). Furthermore, one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences in spine density and morphology for thin, long-thin, mushroom, stubby, and bifurcated spine types across pubertal, postpubertal, and adult stages. Similarly, in Layer 5, we observed a significant decrease in total mean spine density from the pubertal stage (M = 9.41, SEM = 0.91) to the postpubertal stage (M = 5.52, SEM = 0.57) (t(50) = 3.53, p \< 0.01). The one-way ANOVA results also indicated significant differences in spine density and morphology for filopodia, thin, long-thin, mushroom, stubby, and bifurcated spine types across the three developmental stages.

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate significant differences in total mean spine density between pubertal and postpubertal wildtype female mice in both Layer 2/3 and Layer 5 of the prelimbic cortex. Additionally, we identified significant differences in the density of various spine types across the three developmental stages. These results suggest that synaptic pruning occurs in the prelimbic cortex of female wildtype mice during different developmental stages and may be associated with changes in spine density and morphology. Understanding these alterations can help shed light on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the development and function of the nervous system in female wildtype mice.

## Specific Aim 2

To examine the influence of GABAARs on dendritic pruning in Layer 5 of female mice, a range of drugs targeting these receptors were administered to postpubertal mice in comparison to the wild-type group. The drugs used in this study include Gaboxadol, Picrotoxin, Lorazepam, Memantine, and MK-801.

Mice were divided into several experimental groups based on the drug administered: 1. Wild-type (WT) control group: no drugs administered; 2. Gaboxadol group: selectively targets the delta GABAARs; 3. Picrotoxin group: non-competitive GABAAR antagonist; 4. Lorazepam group: cannot bind to α4βδ GABAARs; 5. Memantine group: NMDA receptor antagonist; 6. MK-801 group: NMDA receptor antagonist.\\

Mice were administered their respective drugs according to the dosages and durations recommended in the literature. The drugs were administered via intraperitoneal injection or oral gavage, as appropriate. Following drug administration, dendritic spines of Layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex were examined using confocal microscopy. Dendritic spine density, as well as the morphological classification of spines (i.e., filopodia, thin, long-thin, mushroom, stubby, and bifurcated), was determined for each experimental group.

Statistical analysis was conducted to compare the total mean spine density and the morphological classification of spines between the different experimental groups. Independent t-tests were performed to compare the means of spine density and morphology between the WT control group and each drug-treated group. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc Tukey's test was used when comparing multiple drug-treated groups. The level of significance was set at p \< 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics software (version 26).

Results from this analysis will provide insight into the role of GABAARs in dendritic pruning in Layer 5 female mice and may help to identify potential therapeutic targets for the modulation of dendritic spine density and morphology.
